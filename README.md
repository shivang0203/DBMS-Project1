# Restaurant Management Website

The Restaurant Management Website is a web application designed to help restaurants effectively manage their food categories, handle customer orders, track revenue generated, and provide controlled access for administrators. This README file provides an overview of the website's features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Features

1. **Food Category Management**: The website allows administrators to add, edit, and delete food categories available in the restaurant. Each category can have a name, description, and associated image.

2. **Admin Access Control**: The website provides a secure login system to manage access for administrators. Only authorized administrators can perform actions such as adding or modifying food categories, managing customer orders, and tracking revenue.

3. **Customer Order Management**: Customers can browse food categories, select items, and place orders through the website. The system captures order details, including the customer's name, contact information, selected items, and order status.

4. **Revenue Tracking**: The website keeps track of the revenue generated from customer orders. It calculates and displays total revenue, allowing administrators to monitor the financial performance of the restaurant.

- **HTML**: Markup language for creating the website's structure.
- **CSS**: Styling language used to design the website's appearance.
